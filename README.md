# -Single-Cell-Analysis-Using-Deep-Learning
 This project aims to explore the application of advanced deep learning techniques for clustering  single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. By leveraging neural network architectures, the  objective is to learn complex and meaningful high-dimensional representations of the data that  capture underlying biological patterns.
